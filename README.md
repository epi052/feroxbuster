## üòï What the heck is a ferox anyway?

Ferox is short for Ferric Oxide. Ferric Oxide, simply put, is rust. The name
rustbuster was taken, so I decided on a variation. ü§∑

## ü§î What's it do tho?

`feroxbuster` is a tool designed to perform
[Forced Browsing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Forced_browsing).

Forced browsing is an attack where the aim is to enumerate and access resources
that are not referenced by the web application, but are still accessible by an
attacker.

`feroxbuster` uses brute force combined with a wordlist to search for unlinked
content in target directories. These resources may store sensitive information
about web applications and operational systems, such as source code,
credentials, internal network addressing, etc...

This attack is also known as Predictable Resource Location, File Enumeration,
Directory Enumeration, and Resource Enumeration.

## üíø Installation

### Download a Release

Releases for multiple architectures can be found in the
[Releases](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/releases) section. The latest
release for each of the following systems can be downloaded and executed as
shown below.

#### Linux (32 and 64-bit) & MacOS

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epi052/feroxbuster/master/install-nix.sh | bash
```

#### Windows x86

```
https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/releases/latest/download/x86-windows-feroxbuster.exe.zip
Expand-Archive .\feroxbuster.zip
.\feroxbuster\feroxbuster.exe -V
```

#### Windows x86_64

```
Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/releases/latest/download/x86_64-windows-feroxbuster.exe.zip -OutFile feroxbuster.zip
Expand-Archive .\feroxbuster.zip
.\feroxbuster\feroxbuster.exe -V
```

### Snap Install

Install using `snap`

```
sudo snap install feroxbuster
```

The only gotcha here is that the snap package can only read wordlists from a few
specific locations. There are a few possible solutions, of which two are shown
below.

If the wordlist is on the same partition as your home directory, it can be
hard-linked into `~/snap/feroxbuster/common`

```
ln /path/to/the/wordlist ~/snap/feroxbuster/common
./feroxbuster -u http://localhost -w ~/snap/feroxbuster/common/wordlist
```

If the wordlist is on a separate partition, hard-linking won't work. You'll need
to copy it into the snap directory.

```
cp /path/to/the/wordlist ~/snap/feroxbuster/common
./feroxbuster -u http://localhost -w ~/snap/feroxbuster/common/wordlist
```

### Homebrew on MacOS and Linux

Install using Homebrew via tap

üçè
[MacOS](https://github.com/TGotwig/homebrew-feroxbuster/blob/main/feroxbuster.rb)

```shell
brew tap tgotwig/feroxbuster
brew install feroxbuster
```

üêß
[Linux](https://github.com/TGotwig/homebrew-linux-feroxbuster/blob/main/feroxbuster.rb)

```shell
brew tap tgotwig/linux-feroxbuster
brew install feroxbuster
```

### Cargo Install

`feroxbuster` is published on crates.io, making it easy to install if you
already have rust installed on your system.

```
cargo install feroxbuster
```

### apt Install

Download `feroxbuster_amd64.deb` from the
[Releases](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/releases) section. After that,
use your favorite package manager to install the `.deb`.

```
wget -sLO https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/releases/latest/download/feroxbuster_amd64.deb.zip
unzip feroxbuster_amd64.deb.zip
sudo apt install ./feroxbuster_amd64.deb
```

### AUR Install

Install `feroxbuster-git` on Arch Linux with your AUR helper of choice:

```
yay -S feroxbuster-git
```

### Docker Install

> The following steps assume you have docker installed / setup

First, clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster.git
cd feroxbuster
```

Next, build the image.

```
sudo docker build -t feroxbuster .
```

After that, you should be able to use `docker run` to perform scans with
`feroxbuster`.

#### Basic usage

```
sudo docker run --init -it feroxbuster -u http://example.com -x js,html
```

#### Piping from stdin and proxying all requests through socks5 proxy

```
cat targets.txt | sudo docker run --net=host --init -i feroxbuster --stdin -x js,html --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050
```

#### Mount a volume to pass in `ferox-config.toml`

You've got some options available if you want to pass in a config file.
[`ferox-buster.toml`](#ferox-configtoml) can live in multiple locations and
still be valid, so it's up to you how you'd like to pass it in. Below are a few
valid examples:

```
sudo docker run --init -v $(pwd)/ferox-config.toml:/etc/feroxbuster/ferox-config.toml -it feroxbuster -u http://example.com
```

```
sudo docker run --init -v ~/.config/feroxbuster:/root/.config/feroxbuster -it feroxbuster -u http://example.com
```

Note: If you are on a SELinux enforced system, you will need to pass the `:Z`
attribute also.

```
docker run --init -v (pwd)/ferox-config.toml:/etc/feroxbuster/ferox-config.toml:Z -it feroxbuster -u http://example.com
```

#### Define an alias for simplicity

```
alias feroxbuster="sudo docker run --init -v ~/.config/feroxbuster:/root/.config/feroxbuster -i feroxbuster"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Default Values

Configuration begins with with the following built-in default values baked into
the binary:

- timeout: `7` seconds
- follow redirects: `false`
- wordlist:
  `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt`
- threads: `50`
- verbosity: `0` (no logging enabled)
- scan_limit: `0` (no limit imposed on concurrent scans)
- status_codes: `200 204 301 302 307 308 401 403 405`
- user_agent: `feroxbuster/VERSION`
- recursion depth: `4`
- auto-filter wildcards - `true`
- output: `stdout`
- save_state: `true` (create a state file in cwd when `Ctrl+C` is received)

### Threads and Connection Limits At A High-Level

This section explains how the `-t` and `-L` options work together to determine
the overall aggressiveness of a scan. The combination of the two values set by
these options determines how hard your target will get hit and to some extent
also determines how many resources will be consumed on your local machine.

#### A Note on Green Threads

`feroxbuster` uses so-called
[green threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads) as opposed to
traditional kernel/OS threads. This means (at a high-level) that the threads are
implemented entirely in userspace, within a single running process. As a result,
a scan with 30 green threads will appear to the OS to be a single process with
no additional light-weight processes associated with it as far as the kernel is
concerned. As such, there will not be any impact to process (`nproc`) limits
when specifying larger values for `-t`. However, these threads will still
consume file descriptors, so you will need to ensure that you have a suitable
`nlimit` set when scaling up the amount of threads. More detailed documentation
on setting appropriate `nlimit` values can be found in the
[No File Descriptors Available](#no-file-descriptors-available) section of the
FAQ

#### Threads and Connection Limits: The Implementation

- Threads: The `-t` option specifies the maximum amount of active threads
  _per-directory_ during a scan
- Connection Limits: The `-L` option specifies the maximum amount of active
  connections per thread

#### Threads and Connection Limits: Examples

To truly have only 30 active requests to a site at any given time, `-t 30 -L 1`
is necessary. Using `-t 30 -L 2` will result in a maximum of 60 total requests
being processed at any given time for that site. And so on. For a conversation
on this, please see
[Issue #126](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/issues/126) which may provide
more (or less) clarity :wink:

### ferox-config.toml

After setting built-in default values, any values defined in a
`ferox-config.toml` config file will override the built-in defaults.

`feroxbuster` searches for `ferox-config.toml` in the following locations (in
the order shown):

- `/etc/feroxbuster/` (global)
- `CONFIG_DIR/ferxobuster/` (per-user)
- The same directory as the `feroxbuster` executable (per-user)
- The user's current working directory (per-target)

> `CONFIG_DIR` is defined as the following:
>
> - Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `$HOME/.config` i.e. `/home/bob/.config`
> - MacOs: `$HOME/Library/Application Support` i.e.
>   `/Users/bob/Library/Application Support`
> - Windows: `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}` i.e. `C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Roaming`

If more than one valid configuration file is found, each one overwrites the
values found previously.

If no configuration file is found, nothing happens at this stage.

As an example, let's say that we prefer to use a different wordlist as our
default when scanning; we can set the `wordlist` value in the config file to
override the baked-in default.

Notes of interest:

- it's ok to only specify values you want to change without specifying anything
  else
- variable names in `ferox-config.toml` must match their command-line
  counterpart

```toml
# ferox-config.toml

wordlist = "/wordlists/jhaddix/all.txt"
```

A pre-made configuration file with examples of all available settings can be
found in `ferox-config.toml.example`.

```toml
# ferox-config.toml
# Example configuration for feroxbuster
#
# If you wish to provide persistent settings to feroxbuster, rename this file to ferox-config.toml and make sure
# it resides in the same directory as the feroxbuster binary.
#
# After that, uncomment any line to override the default value provided by the binary itself.
#
# Any setting used here can be overridden by the corresponding command line option/argument
#
# wordlist = "/wordlists/jhaddix/all.txt"
# status_codes = [200, 500]
# filter_status = [301]
# threads = 1
# timeout = 5
# proxy = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
# replay_proxy = "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
# replay_codes = [200, 302]
# verbosity = 1
# scan_limit = 6
# quiet = true
# json = true
# output = "/targets/ellingson_mineral_company/gibson.txt"
# debug_log = "/var/log/find-the-derp.log"
# user_agent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0"
# redirects = true
# insecure = true
# extensions = ["php", "html"]
# no_recursion = true
# add_slash = true
# stdin = true
# dont_filter = true
# extract_links = true
# depth = 1
# filter_size = [5174]
# filter_regex = ["^ignore me$"]
# filter_word_count = [993]
# filter_line_count = [35, 36]
# queries = [["name","value"], ["rick", "astley"]]
# save_state = false
# time_limit = 10m

# headers can be specified on multiple lines or as an inline table
#
# inline example
# headers = {"stuff" = "things"}
#
# multi-line example
#   note: if multi-line is used, all key/value pairs under it belong to the headers table until the next table
#         is found or the end of the file is reached
#
# [headers]
# stuff = "things"
# more = "headers"
```

### Command Line Parsing

Finally, after parsing the available config file, any options/arguments given on
the commandline will override any values that were set as a built-in or
config-file value.

## üß∞ Example Usage

### Multiple Values

Options that take multiple values are very flexible. Consider the following ways
of specifying extensions:

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 -x pdf -x js,html -x php txt json,docx
```

The command above adds .pdf, .js, .html, .php, .txt, .json, and .docx to each
url

All of the methods above (multiple flags, space separated, comma separated,
etc...) are valid and interchangeable. The same goes for urls, headers, status
codes, queries, and size filters.

### Include Headers

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 -H Accept:application/json "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

### IPv6, non-recursive scan with INFO-level logging enabled

```
./feroxbuster -u http://[::1] --no-recursion -vv
```

### Read urls from STDIN; pipe only resulting urls out to another tool

```
cat targets | ./feroxbuster --stdin --quiet -s 200 301 302 --redirects -x js | fff -s 200 -o js-files
```

### Proxy traffic through Burp

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --insecure --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Proxy traffic through a SOCKS proxy (including DNS lookups)

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050
```

### Pass auth token via query parameter

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --query token=0123456789ABCDEF
```

### Extract Links from Response Body (New in `v1.1.0`)

Search through the body of valid responses (html, javascript, etc...) for
additional endpoints to scan. This turns `feroxbuster` into a hybrid that looks
for both linked and unlinked content.

Example request/response with `--extract-links` enabled:

- Make request to `http://example.com/index.html`
- Receive, and read in, the `body` of the response
- Search the `body` for absolute and relative links (i.e.
  `homepage/assets/img/icons/handshake.svg`)
- Add the following directories for recursive scanning:
  - `http://example.com/homepage`
  - `http://example.com/homepage/assets`
  - `http://example.com/homepage/assets/img`
  - `http://example.com/homepage/assets/img/icons`
- Make a single request to
  `http://example.com/homepage/assets/img/icons/handshake.svg`

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --extract-links
```

Here's a comparison of a wordlist-only scan vs `--extract-links` using
[Feline](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/274) from Hack the Box:

Wordlist only

![normal-scan-cmp-extract](img/normal-scan-cmp-extract.gif)

With `--extract-links`

![extract-scan-cmp-normal](img/extract-scan-cmp-normal.gif)

### Limit Total Number of Concurrent Scans (new in `v1.2.0`)

Limit the number of scans permitted to run at any given time. Recursion will
still identify new directories, but newly discovered directories can only begin
scanning when the total number of active scans drops below the value passed to
`--scan-limit`.

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --scan-limit 2
```

![limit-demo](img/limit-demo.gif)

### Filter Response by Status Code (new in `v1.3.0`)

Version 1.3.0 included an overhaul to the filtering system which will allow for
a wide array of filters to be added with minimal effort. The first such filter
is a Status Code Filter. As responses come back from the scanned server, each
one is checked against a list of known filters and either displayed or not
according to which filters are set.

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --filter-status 301
```

### Pause an Active Scan (new in `v1.4.0`)

Scans can be paused and resumed by pressing the ENTER key (shown below)

![pause-resume-demo](img/pause-resume-demo.gif)

### Replay Responses to a Proxy based on Status Code (new in `v1.5.0`)

The `--replay-proxy` and `--replay-codes` options were added as a way to only
send a select few responses to a proxy. This is in stark contrast to `--proxy`
which proxies EVERY request.

Imagine you only care about proxying responses that have either the status code
`200` or `302` (or you just don't want to clutter up your Burp history). These
two options will allow you to fine-tune what gets proxied and what doesn't.

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --replay-proxy http://localhost:8080 --replay-codes 200 302 --insecure
```

Of note: this means that for every response that matches your replay criteria,
you'll end up sending the request that generated that response a second time.
Depending on the target and your engagement terms (if any), it may not make
sense from a traffic generated perspective.

### Filter Response by Word Count & Line Count (new in `v1.6.0`)

In addition to filtering on the size of a response, version 1.6.0 added the
ability to filter out responses based on the number of lines and/or words
contained within the response body. This change drove a change to the
information displayed to the user as well. This section will detail the new
information and how to make use of it with the new filters provided.

Example output:

```
200        10l        212w       38437c https://example-site.com/index.html
```

There are five columns of output above:

- column 1: status code - can be filtered with `-C|--filter-status`
- column 2: number of lines - can be filtered with `-N|--filter-lines`
- column 3: number of words - can be filtered with `-W|--filter-words`
- column 4: number of bytes (overall size) - can be filtered with
  `-S|--filter-size`
- column 5: url to discovered resource

### Filter Response Using a Regular Expression (new in `v1.8.0`)

Version 1.3.0 included an overhaul to the filtering system which will allow for
a wide array of filters to be added with minimal effort. The latest addition is
a Regular Expression Filter. As responses come back from the scanned server, the
**body** of the response is checked against the filter's regular expression. If
the expression is found in the body, then that response is filtered out.

**NOTE: Using regular expressions to filter large responses or many regular
expressions may negatively impact performance.**

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --filter-regex '[aA]ccess [dD]enied.?' --output results.txt --json
```

### Stop and Resume Scans (`--resume-from FILE`) (new in `v1.9.0`)

Version 1.9.0 adds a few features that allow for completely stopping a scan, and
resuming that same scan from a file on disk.

A simple `Ctrl+C` during a scan will create a file that contains information
about the scan that was cancelled.

![save-state](img/save-state.png)

```json
// example snippet of state file

{
   "scans":[
      {
         "id":"057016a14769414aac9a7a62707598cb",
         "url":"https://localhost.com",
         "scan_type":"Directory",
         "complete":true
      },
      {
         "id":"400b2323a16f43468a04ffcbbeba34c6",
         "url":"https://localhost.com/css",
         "scan_type":"Directory",
         "complete":false
      }
   ],
   "config":{
      "wordlist":"/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt",
      "...":"..."
   },
   "responses":[
      {
         "type":"response",
         "url":"https://localhost.com/Login",
         "path":"/Login",
         "wildcard":false,
         "status":302,
         "content_length":0,
         "line_count":0,
         "word_count":0,
         "headers":{
            "content-length":"0",
            "server":"nginx/1.16.1"
         }
      }
   ]
},
```

Based on the example image above, the same scan can be resumed by using
`feroxbuster --resume-from ferox-http_localhost-1606947491.state`. Directories
that were already complete are not rescanned, however partially complete scans
are started from the beginning.

![resumed-scan](img/resumed-scan.gif)

In order to prevent state file creation when `Ctrl+C` is pressed, you can simply
add the entry below to your `ferox-config.toml`.

```toml
# ferox-config.toml

save_state = false
```

### Enforce a Time Limit on Your Scan (new in `v1.10.0`)

Version 1.10.0 adds the ability to set a maximum runtime, or time limit, on your
scan. The usage is pretty simple: a number followed directly by a single
character representing seconds, minutes, hours, or days. `feroxbuster` refers to
this combination as a time_spec.

Examples of possible time_specs:

- `30s` - 30 seconds
- `20m` - 20 minutes
- `1h` - 1 hour
- `1d` - 1 day (why??)

A valid time_spec can be passed to `--time-limit` in order to force a shutdown
after the given time has elapsed.

![time-limit](img/time-limit.gif)

### Extract Links from robots.txt (New in `v1.10.2`)

In addition to
[extracting links from the response body](#extract-links-from-response-body-new-in-v110),
using `--extract-links` makes a request to `/robots.txt` and examines all
`Allow` and `Disallow` entries. Directory entries are added to the scan queue,
while file entries are requested and then reported if appropriate.

## üßê Comparison w/ Similar Tools

There are quite a few similar tools for forced browsing/content discovery. Burp
Suite Pro, Dirb, Dirbuster, etc... However, in my opinion, there are two that
set the standard: [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) and
[ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf). Both are mature, feature-rich, and
all-around incredible tools to use.

So, why would you ever want to use feroxbuster over ffuf/gobuster? In most
cases, you probably won't. ffuf in particular can do the vast majority of things
that feroxbuster can, while still offering boatloads more functionality. Here
are a few of the use-cases in which feroxbuster may be a better fit:

- You want a **simple** tool usage experience
- You want to be able to run your content discovery as part of some crazy 12
  command unix **pipeline extravaganza**
- You want to scan through a **SOCKS** proxy
- You want **auto-filtering** of Wildcard responses by default
- You want an integrated **link extractor** to increase discovered endpoints
- You want **recursion** along with some other thing mentioned above (ffuf also
  does recursion)
- You want a **configuration file** option for overriding built-in default
  values for your scans

Of note, there's another written-in-rust content discovery tool,
[rustbuster](https://github.com/phra/rustbuster). I came across rustbuster when
I was naming my tool (üò¢). I don't have any experience using it, but it appears
to be able to do POST requests with an HTTP body, has SOCKS support, and has an
8.3 shortname scanner (in addition to vhost dns, directory, etc...). In short,
it definitely looks interesting and may be what you're looking for as it has
some capability I haven't seen in similar tools.

## ü§Ø Common Problems/Issues (FAQ)

### No file descriptors available

Why do I get a bunch of `No file descriptors available (os error 24)` errors?

---

There are a few potential causes of this error. The simplest is that your
operating system sets an open file limit that is aggressively low. Through
personal testing, I've found that `4096` is a reasonable open file limit (this
will vary based on your exact setup).

There are quite a few options to solve this particular problem, of which a
handful are shown below.

#### Increase the Number of Open Files

We'll start by increasing the number of open files the OS allows. On my Kali
install, the default was `1024`, and I know some MacOS installs use `256` üòï.

##### Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf`

One option to up the limit is to edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` so that it
includes the two lines below.

- `*` represents all users
- `hard` and `soft` indicate the hard and soft limits for the OS
- `nofile` is the number of open files option.

```
/etc/security/limits.conf
-------------------------
...
*        soft nofile 4096
*        hard nofile 8192
...
```

##### Use `ulimit` directly

A faster option, that is **not** persistent, is to simply use the `ulimit`
command to change the setting.

```
ulimit -n 4096
```

#### Additional Tweaks (may not be needed)

If you still find yourself hitting the file limit with the above changes, there
are a few additional tweaks that may help.

‚ú® Special thanks to HTB user
[@sparkla](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/221599) for their help
with identifying these additional tweaks ‚ú®

##### Increase the ephemeral port range, and decrease the tcp_fin_timeout.

The ephermal port range defines the maximum number of outbound sockets a host
can create from a particular I.P. address. The fin_timeout defines the minimum
time these sockets will stay in TIME_WAIT state (unusable after being used
once). Usual system defaults are

- `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 32768 61000`
- `net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 60`

This basically means your system cannot consistently guarantee more than
`(61000 - 32768) / 60 = 470` sockets per second.

```
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="15000 61000"
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=30
```

##### Allow socket reuse while in a `TIME_WAIT` status

This allows fast cycling of sockets in time_wait state and re-using them. Make
sure to read post
[Coping with the TCP TIME-WAIT](https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2014-tcp-time-wait-state-linux)
from Vincent Bernat to understand the implications.

```
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1
```

### Progress bars print one line at a time

`feroxbuster` needs a terminal width of at least the size of what's being
printed in order to do progress bar printing correctly. If your width is too
small, you may see output like what's shown below.

![small-term](img/small-term.png)

If you can, simply make the terminal wider and rerun. If you're unable to make
your terminal wider consider using `-q` to suppress the progress bars.

### What do each of the numbers beside the URL mean?

Please refer to
[this section](#filter-response-by-word-count--line-count--new-in-v160) where
each number's meaning and how to use it to filter responses is discussed.

### Connection closed before message completed

The error in question can be boiled down to 'networking stuff'. `feroxbuster`
uses [reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/) which uses
[hyper](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/) to make requests to the server.
[This issue report](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2136#issuecomment-589345238)
to the hyper project explains what is happening (quoted below to save you a
click). This isn't a bug so much as it's a target-specific tuning issue. When
lowering the `-t` value, the error doesn't occur (or happens much less
frequently).

This isn't a bug. Simply slow down the scan. A `-t` value of 50 was chosen as a
sane default that's still quite fast out of the box. However, network related
errors may occur when the client and/or server become over-saturated. The
[Threads and Connection Limits At A High-Level](#threads-and-connection-limits-at-a-high-level)
section details how to accomplish per-target tuning.

### SSL Error routines:tls_process_server_certificate:certificate verify failed

In the event you see an error similar to

![self-signed](img/insecure.png)

```
error trying to connect: error:1416F086:SSL routines:tls_process_server_certificate:certificate verify failed:ssl/statem/statem_clnt.c:1913: (self signed certificate)
```

You just need to add the `-k|--insecure` flag to your command.

`feroxbuster` rejects self-signed certs and other "insecure" certificates/site
configurations by default. You can choose to scan these services anyway by
telling `feroxbuster` to ignore insecure server certs.
