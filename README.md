## üòï What the heck is a ferox anyway?

Ferox is short for Ferric Oxide. Ferric Oxide, simply put, is rust.  The name rustbuster was taken, so I decided on a variation.  ü§∑	

## ü§î What's it do tho? 

`feroxbuster` is a tool designed to perform [Forced Browsing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Forced_browsing).  

Forced browsing is an attack where the aim is to enumerate and access resources that are not referenced by the web application, but are still accessible by an attacker.

`feroxbuster` uses brute force combined with a wordlist to search for unlinked content in target directories. These resources may store sensitive information about web applications and operational systems, such as source code, credentials, internal network addressing, etc...

This attack is also known as Predictable Resource Location, File Enumeration, Directory Enumeration, and Resource Enumeration.

## üíø Installation

### Download a Release

Releases for multiple architectures can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/releases) section.  The latest release for each of the following systems can be downloaded and executed as shown below.

#### Linux (32 and 64-bit) & MacOS
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epi052/feroxbuster/master/install-nix.sh | bash
```

#### Windows x86

```
https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/releases/latest/download/x86-windows-feroxbuster.exe.zip
Expand-Archive .\feroxbuster.zip
.\feroxbuster\feroxbuster.exe -V
```

#### Windows x86_64

```
Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/releases/latest/download/x86_64-windows-feroxbuster.exe.zip -OutFile feroxbuster.zip
Expand-Archive .\feroxbuster.zip
.\feroxbuster\feroxbuster.exe -V
```

### Snap Install

Install using `snap`

```
sudo snap install feroxbuster
```

The only gotcha here is that the snap package can only read wordlists from a few specific locations. There are a few 
possible solutions, of which two are shown below.

If the wordlist is on the same partition as your home directory, it can be hard-linked into `~/snap/feroxbuster/common`

```
ln /path/to/the/wordlist ~/snap/feroxbuster/common
./feroxbuster -u http://localhost -w ~/snap/feroxbuster/common/wordlist
``` 

If the wordlist is on a separate partition, hard-linking won't work.  You'll need to copy it into the snap directory.

```
cp /path/to/the/wordlist ~/snap/feroxbuster/common
./feroxbuster -u http://localhost -w ~/snap/feroxbuster/common/wordlist
``` 

### Homebrew on MacOS and Linux

Install using Homebrew via tap

üçè [MacOS](https://github.com/TGotwig/homebrew-feroxbuster/blob/main/feroxbuster.rb)

```shell
brew tap tgotwig/feroxbuster
brew install feroxbuster
```

üêß [Linux](https://github.com/TGotwig/homebrew-linux-feroxbuster/blob/main/feroxbuster.rb)

```shell
brew tap tgotwig/linux-feroxbuster
brew install feroxbuster
```

### Cargo Install

`feroxbuster` is published on crates.io, making it easy to install if you already have rust installed on your system.

```
cargo install feroxbuster
```

#### Peculiarities When Redirecting https:// => ssh:// via `git` Configuration

When performing a `cargo` build under some user `git` configurations, particularly those redirecting from https:// to ssh://, you may need to set `CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI=true` in your environment, per the documentation [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#netgit-fetch-with-cli) or you will receive an error along the lines of `Failed to retrieve list of SSH authentication methods: Failed getting response; class=Ssh (23)`

### apt Install

Download `feroxbuster_amd64.deb` from the [Releases](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/releases) section.  After that, use your favorite package manager to install the `.deb`.

```
wget -sLO https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/releases/latest/download/feroxbuster_amd64.deb.zip
unzip feroxbuster_amd64.deb.zip
sudo apt install ./feroxbuster_amd64.deb
```

### AUR Install

Install `feroxbuster-git` on Arch Linux with your AUR helper of choice:

```
yay -S feroxbuster-git
```

### Docker Install

> The following steps assume you have docker installed / setup

First, clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster.git
cd feroxbuster
```

Next, build the image.

```
sudo docker build -t feroxbuster .
```

After that, you should be able to use `docker run` to perform scans with `feroxbuster`.

#### Basic usage

```
sudo docker run --init -it feroxbuster -u http://example.com -x js,html
```

#### Piping from stdin and proxying all requests through socks5 proxy

```
cat targets.txt | sudo docker run --net=host --init -i feroxbuster --stdin -x js,html --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050
```

#### Mount a volume to pass in `ferox-config.toml`

You've got some options available if you want to pass in a config file.  [`ferox-buster.toml`](#ferox-configtoml) can live in multiple locations and still be valid, so it's up to you how you'd like to pass it in.  Below are a few valid examples:

```
sudo docker run --init -v $(pwd)/ferox-config.toml:/etc/feroxbuster/ferox-config.toml -it feroxbuster -u http://example.com
```

```
sudo docker run --init -v ~/.config/feroxbuster:/root/.config/feroxbuster -it feroxbuster -u http://example.com
```

Note: If you are on a SELinux enforced system, you will need to pass the `:Z` attribute also.

```
docker run --init -v (pwd)/ferox-config.toml:/etc/feroxbuster/ferox-config.toml:Z -it feroxbuster -u http://example.com
```

#### Define an alias for simplicity

```
alias feroxbuster="sudo docker run --init -v ~/.config/feroxbuster:/root/.config/feroxbuster -i feroxbuster"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
### Default Values
Configuration begins with with the following built-in default values baked into the binary:

- timeout: `7` seconds
- follow redirects: `false`
- wordlist: `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt`
- threads: `50`
- verbosity: `0` (no logging enabled)
- scan_limit: `0` (no limit imposed on concurrent scans)
- status_codes: `200 204 301 302 307 308 401 403 405`
- user_agent: `feroxbuster/VERSION`
- recursion depth: `4`
- auto-filter wildcards - `true`
- output: `stdout`

### ferox-config.toml
After setting built-in default values, any values defined in a `ferox-config.toml` config file will override the
built-in defaults.  

`feroxbuster` searches for `ferox-config.toml` in the following locations (in the order shown):
- `/etc/feroxbuster/` (global)
- `CONFIG_DIR/ferxobuster/` (per-user)
- The same directory as the `feroxbuster` executable (per-user)
- The user's current working directory (per-target)

> `CONFIG_DIR` is defined as the following:
> - Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `$HOME/.config` i.e. `/home/bob/.config`
> - MacOs: `$HOME/Library/Application Support` i.e. `/Users/bob/Library/Application Support`
> - Windows: `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}` i.e. `C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Roaming`

If more than one valid configuration file is found, each one overwrites the values found previously.  

If no configuration file is found, nothing happens at this stage.

As an example, let's say that we prefer to use a different wordlist as our default when scanning; we can
set the `wordlist` value in the config file to override the baked-in default.

Notes of interest:
- it's ok to only specify values you want to change without specifying anything else
- variable names in `ferox-config.toml` must match their command-line counterpart

```toml
# ferox-config.toml

wordlist = "/wordlists/jhaddix/all.txt"
```

A pre-made configuration file with examples of all available settings can be found in `ferox-config.toml.example`.
```toml
# ferox-config.toml
# Example configuration for feroxbuster
#
# If you wish to provide persistent settings to feroxbuster, rename this file to ferox-config.toml and make sure
# it resides in the same directory as the feroxbuster binary.
#
# After that, uncomment any line to override the default value provided by the binary itself.
#
# Any setting used here can be overridden by the corresponding command line option/argument
#
# wordlist = "/wordlists/jhaddix/all.txt"
# status_codes = [200, 500]
# filter_status = [301]
# replay_codes = [301]
# threads = 1
# timeout = 5
# proxy = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
# replay_proxy = "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
# verbosity = 1
# scan_limit = 6
# quiet = true
# output = "/targets/ellingson_mineral_company/gibson.txt"
# user_agent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0"
# redirects = true
# insecure = true
# extensions = ["php", "html"]
# no_recursion = true
# add_slash = true
# stdin = true
# dont_filter = true
# extract_links = true
# depth = 1
# filter_size = [5174]
# queries = [["name","value"], ["rick", "astley"]]

# headers can be specified on multiple lines or as an inline table
#
# inline example
# headers = {"stuff" = "things"}
#
# multi-line example
#   note: if multi-line is used, all key/value pairs under it belong to the headers table until the next table
#         is found or the end of the file is reached
#
# [headers]
# stuff = "things"
# more = "headers"
```

### Command Line Parsing
Finally, after parsing the available config file, any options/arguments given on the commandline will override any values that were set as a built-in or config-file value.

## üß∞ Example Usage

### Pause and Resume Scans (new in `v1.4.0`)

Scans can be paused and resumed by pressing the ENTER key (shown below)

![pause-resume-demo](img/pause-resume-demo.gif)

### Multiple Values

Options that take multiple values are very flexible.  Consider the following ways of specifying extensions:

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 -x pdf -x js,html -x php txt json,docx
```

The command above adds .pdf, .js, .html, .php, .txt, .json, and .docx to each url

All of the methods above (multiple flags, space separated, comma separated, etc...) are valid and interchangeable.  The same goes for urls, headers, status codes, queries, and size filters.

### Include Headers

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 -H Accept:application/json "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

### Extract Links from Response Body (New in `v1.1.0`) 

Search through the body of valid responses (html, javascript, etc...) for additional endpoints to scan. This turns
`feroxbuster` into a hybrid that looks for both linked and unlinked content. 

Example request/response with `--extract-links` enabled:
- Make request to `http://example.com/index.html`
- Receive, and read in, the `body` of the response
- Search the `body` for absolute and relative links (i.e. `homepage/assets/img/icons/handshake.svg`)
- Add the following directories for recursive scanning:
    - `http://example.com/homepage`
    - `http://example.com/homepage/assets`
    - `http://example.com/homepage/assets/img`
    - `http://example.com/homepage/assets/img/icons`
- Make a single request to `http://example.com/homepage/assets/img/icons/handshake.svg`

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --extract-links
```

Here's a comparison of a wordlist-only scan vs `--extract-links` using [Feline](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/274) from Hack the Box:

Wordlist only

![normal-scan-cmp-extract](img/normal-scan-cmp-extract.gif)

With `--extract-links`

![extract-scan-cmp-normal](img/extract-scan-cmp-normal.gif)


### IPv6, non-recursive scan with INFO-level logging enabled

```
./feroxbuster -u http://[::1] --no-recursion -vv
```

### Read urls from STDIN; pipe only resulting urls out to another tool

```
cat targets | ./feroxbuster --stdin --quiet -s 200 301 302 --redirects -x js | fff -s 200 -o js-files
```

### Proxy traffic through Burp

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --insecure --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Proxy traffic through a SOCKS proxy

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050
```

### Pass auth token via query parameter 

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --query token=0123456789ABCDEF
```

### Limit Total Number of Concurrent Scans (new in `v1.2.0`)

Limit the number of scans permitted to run at any given time.  Recursion will still identify new directories, but newly
discovered directories can only begin scanning when the total number of active scans drops below the value passed to 
`--scan-limit`.

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --scan-limit 2
```

![limit-demo](img/limit-demo.gif)

### Filter Response by Status Code  (new in `v1.3.0`)

Version 1.3.0 included an overhaul to the filtering system which will allow for a wide array of filters to be added 
with minimal effort. The first such filter is a Status Code Filter. As responses come back from the scanned server,
each one is checked against a list of known filters and either displayed or not according to which filters are set.

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --filter-status 301
```

### Replay Responses to a Proxy based on Status Code (new in `v1.5.0`)

The `--replay-proxy` and `--replay-codes` options were added as a way to only send a select few responses to a proxy.  This is in stark contrast to `--proxy` which proxies EVERY request.  

Imagine you only care about proxying responses that have either the status code `200` or `302` (or you just don't want to clutter up your Burp history).  These two options will allow you to fine-tune what gets proxied and what doesn't.  

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --replay-proxy http://localhost:8080 --replay-codes 200 302 --insecure
```

Of note: this means that for every response that matches your replay criteria, you'll end up sending the request that generated that response a second time.  Depending on the target and your engagement terms (if any), it may not make sense from a traffic generated perspective.

## üßê Comparison w/ Similar Tools

There are quite a few similar tools for forced browsing/content discovery.  Burp Suite Pro, Dirb, Dirbuster, etc... 
However, in my opinion, there are two that set the standard: [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) and 
[ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf).  Both are mature, feature-rich, and all-around incredible tools to use.

So, why would you ever want to use feroxbuster over ffuf/gobuster?  In most cases, you probably won't.  ffuf in particular
can do the vast majority of things that feroxbuster can, while still offering boatloads more functionality.  Here are
a few of the use-cases in which feroxbuster may be a better fit:

- You want a **simple** tool usage experience
- You want to be able to run your content discovery as part of some crazy 12 command unix **pipeline extravaganza**
- You want to scan through a **SOCKS** proxy
- You want **auto-filtering** of Wildcard responses by default
- You want an integrated **link extractor** to increase discovered endpoints
- You want **recursion** along with some other thing mentioned above (ffuf also does recursion)
- You want a **configuration file** option for overriding built-in default values for your scans

Of note, there's another written-in-rust content discovery tool, [rustbuster](https://github.com/phra/rustbuster). I 
came across rustbuster when I was naming my tool (üò¢). I don't have any experience using it, but it appears to 
be able to do POST requests with an HTTP body, has SOCKS support, and has an 8.3 shortname scanner (in addition to vhost
dns, directory, etc...).  In short, it definitely looks interesting and may be what you're looking for as it has some 
capability I haven't seen in similar tools.  

## ü§Ø Common Problems/Issues (FAQ)

### No file descriptors available

Why do I get a bunch of `No file descriptors available (os error 24)` errors?

---

There are a few potential causes of this error.  The simplest is that your operating system sets an open file limit that is aggressively low.  Through personal testing, I've found that `4096` is a reasonable open file limit (this will vary based on your exact setup).

There are quite a few options to solve this particular problem, of which a handful are shown below.  

#### Increase the Number of Open Files

We'll start by increasing the number of open files the OS allows. On my Kali install, the default was `1024`, and I know some MacOS installs use `256` üòï.

##### Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf`

One option to up the limit is to edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` so that it includes the two lines below.  

- `*` represents all users
- `hard` and `soft` indicate the hard and soft limits for the OS 
- `nofile` is the number of open files option. 

```
/etc/security/limits.conf
-------------------------
...
*        soft nofile 4096
*        hard nofile 8192
...
```

##### Use `ulimit` directly

A faster option, that is **not** persistent, is to simply use the `ulimit` command to change the setting.

```
ulimit -n 4096
```

#### Additional Tweaks (may not be needed)

If you still find yourself hitting the file limit with the above changes, there are a few additional tweaks that may help.

##### Increase the ephemeral port range, and decrease the tcp_fin_timeout.

The ephermal port range defines the maximum number of outbound sockets a host can create from a particular I.P. address. The fin_timeout defines the minimum time these sockets will stay in TIME_WAIT state (unusable after being used once). Usual system defaults are

- `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 32768   61000`
- `net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 60`

This basically means your system cannot consistently guarantee more than `(61000 - 32768) / 60 = 470` sockets per second.

```
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="15000 61000"
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=30
```

##### Allow socket reuse while in a `TIME_WAIT` status

This allows fast cycling of sockets in time_wait state and re-using them. Make sure to read post [Coping with the TCP TIME-WAIT](https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2014-tcp-time-wait-state-linux) from Vincent Bernat to understand the implications.

```
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1 
```

### Progress bars print one line at a time

`feroxbuster` needs a terminal width of at least the size of what's being printed in order to do progress bar printing correctly.  If your width is too small, you may see output like what's shown below.

If you can, simply make the terminal wider and rerun.  If you're unable to make your terminal wider
consider using `-q` to suppress the progress bars.
